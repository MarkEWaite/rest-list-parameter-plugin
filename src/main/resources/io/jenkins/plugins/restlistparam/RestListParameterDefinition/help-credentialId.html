  Depending on the authentication requirement for the REST/Web endpoint there are three supported methods:<br/>
  <ul>
    <li>`NONE` if there is no authentication requirement simply don't select any _Credential ID_</li>
    <li>`BASIC` if this authentication type is required, then simply select any Username and Password credential in the
      _Credential ID_ field
    </li>
    <li>`BEARER` if this authentication type is required, then simply select any Secret Text credential in the _Credential ID_
      field
    </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The Authentication header will be build and added based on the type of the selected credential type.
