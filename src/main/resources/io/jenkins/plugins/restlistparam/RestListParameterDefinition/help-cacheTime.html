<div>
  Allows the user to cache values returned from a HTTP endpoint.<br/>
  The value is in <strong>MINUTES</strong> where <strong><em>0</em></strong> forces a request and ignores the cache.<br/>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The cache can hold up to 50 MiB, which <em>should</em> be enough for most use-cases.<br/>
  (currently the physical cache size is NOT configurable)
