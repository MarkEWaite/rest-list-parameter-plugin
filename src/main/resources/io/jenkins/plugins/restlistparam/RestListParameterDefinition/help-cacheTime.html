<div>
  Allows the user to cache values returned from a HTTP endpoint.<br/>
  The unit of this value is <strong>MINUTES</strong>. If the value is set to <strong><em>0</em></strong>, a web request is forced.<br/>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The cache can globally hold up to 50 MiB per default, which <em>should</em> be enough for most use-cases.<br/>
  (The maximum size of the cache can be adjusted in the global Jenkins settings)
